This is a find and replace POC I built that uses a template excel file with two columns; one with the find values and the second with the values to replace those values if found in "find" column. Then the user can connect there working file and it will clean the data leaving the original for auditing purposes and add a new sheet with the changes. This is useful for cleaning special characters in excel files before a data upload(also works with csv). This also uses xlwings so the data is updated in real time and works even if the user has the excel or csv files open.
The other functionality is a similar concept to the find and replace. It uses a template file with just one column of values. Then they can connect to their working file and choose to either keep the values found in the vlookup or remove the values that match from the template file.
